#Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, make sure you do all of this before reporting.

- Make sure you are using the latest development build. If you don't, download it and reproduce the same bug to see if it's fixed.
- Look for the same bug in the repo's issues page. Comment on it. We don't want duplicate issues.
- Take note on how to reproduce the bug and tell us. If we can't reproduce it, your issue might be marked as "Can't Reproduce"
- Upload the log file on pastebin.com or similiar site to help us identify root cause of the bug.

#Pull Requests
- Does your changes fit our goals? No? Don't bother submitting it.
- Tell us exactly what does it do.
- Don't include changes with refactoring. Commit it on a separate commit.
- We don't always reject ugly code. But ugly code makes it more likely to be rejected.
- Follow C# code standards.
- Commenting hacky codes is appreciated.

Failing to follow above guidelines will make your PR rejected.
